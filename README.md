# Moneyup Expense Tracker

### Getting Started

In the `index.js` file you can see the `initExpenses()` function that initiates the application.

This application reflects everything that I learned throughout the `Javascript Core Language Path`.

The application uses the following:

- Javascript Basic Types and Variables
- DOM Manipulation using Javascript
- Javascript Objects
- Javascript Arrays
- Javascript Functions
- Javascript Modules

### How to use

Simply clone or the download the repository and run the `index.html` file in your local machine. If you are using VSCode just install the `Live Server Extension`.

Navigate to the `Add Expense` button in the top right corner of the screen.

You will fill up a form with the information of the expense you like to enter. After filling up and submitting the form you will see the application will update.

You can select a month of your choice in the upper right corner and monitor how and where you spend money on frequently.

That's all thank you, and happy tracking!
