# Moneyup Expense Tracker

### Getting Started

In the `index.js` file you can see the `load()` function that initiates the application.

This application reflects everything that I learned throughout the `Javascript Core Language Path`.

The application uses the following:

- Javascript Basic Types and Variables
- DOM Manipulation using Javascript
- Javascript Objects
- Javascript Arrays
- Javascript Functions

### How to use

Simply clone or the download the repository and run the `index.html` file in your local machine.

Navigate to the `Add Expense` button in the top right corner of the screen.

âš  `NOTE`: Select a month first before adding an expense becuase it will be added to the selected month in the dropdown.

You will fill up a form with the information of the expense you like to enter. After filling up and submitting the form you will the total amount of expenses you consume in the month you selected in the dropdown.

That's all thank you, and happy tracking!

### Technologies used

It's a simple application and it only uses vanilla Javascript with HTML and TailwindCSS
